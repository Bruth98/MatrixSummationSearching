# MatrixSummationSearching

# This project had me searching through a 2D matrix horizontally, vertically, and diagonally both ascending and desceding to find which coordinates provided a summation that matched a secret number provided to us. For example, if the given matrix was [10 15 25 35] and the secret number was 50, the program would return a 1D array with the start and end points listed as each element, so something like : [ 0 0 0 2] as the combo started at (0,0) and ended at (0, 2).
